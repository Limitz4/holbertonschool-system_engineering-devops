# Scale Up Infrastructure

## Added Components & Reasons
1. Extra server: More capacity, redundancy
2. HAProxy cluster: Load balancer redundancy, no SPOF
3. Component separation:
   - Dedicated web server: Better static content serving
   - Dedicated app server: Better app processing
   - Dedicated DB server: Better data management

## Application vs Web Server
- Web server: Serves static files (Nginx)
- Application server: Runs app code, processes requests
