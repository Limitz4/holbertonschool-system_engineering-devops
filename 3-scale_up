# Scale Up Infrastructure

## Added Components
1. Additional server
2. HAProxy cluster (2 load balancers)
3. Component separation:
   - Web server on dedicated server
   - Application server on dedicated server  
   - Database on dedicated server

## Why Added
- Extra server: More capacity, redundancy
- HAProxy cluster: Load balancer redundancy, no SPOF
- Component separation: Better resource allocation, independent scaling
