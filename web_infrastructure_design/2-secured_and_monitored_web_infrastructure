# Secured & Monitored 3-Server Infrastructure

## Added Components
1. 3 Firewalls (1 per server)
2. SSL Certificate (HTTPS for www.foobar.com)
3. 3 Monitoring Clients (e.g., Sumologic agents)

## Purpose of Additions
- Firewalls: Block unauthorized access, control traffic
- HTTPS: Encrypt data, prevent interception, build trust
- Monitoring: Track performance, detect issues, collect metrics

## Monitoring
- Tool: Sumologic/Data collector
- Data collection: Agents send logs/metrics to central service
- Monitor QPS: Track web server request rate via logs/metrics

## Issues
1. SSL termination at LB: Decrypted traffic between LB and servers is vulnerable
2. Single MySQL write server: Write SPOF, no failover for writes
3. Same components on all servers: Resource contention, no specialization
