# 3-Server Web Infrastructure

## Components
1. Load Balancer: HAProxy
2. 2 Web Servers:
   - Nginx web server
   - Application server
   - Application code
   - MySQL database (Primary-Replica)

## Why Added
- Load balancer: Distribute traffic, improve availability
- Second server: Redundancy, handle more traffic
- Primary-Replica DB: Read scalability, data backup

## Load Balancer
- Algorithm: Round Robin (rotates requests between servers)
- Setup: Active-Active (both servers handle traffic)

## Database Cluster
- Primary: Handles write operations
- Replica: Handles read operations, syncs from Primary
- App: Writes to Primary, reads from Replica

## Issues
1. SPOF: Load balancer, database primary
2. Security: No firewall, no HTTPS
3. No monitoring
