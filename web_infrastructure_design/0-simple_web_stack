# One Server Web Infrastructure

## Components
1. Domain: foobar.com with www A record pointing to 8.8.8.8
2. Server (8.8.8.8):
   - Web Server: Nginx
   - Application Server
   - Application Files
   - Database: MySQL

## Component Roles
- Server: Computer providing services over network
- Domain Name: Human-readable address mapped to IP via DNS
- www record: A record pointing subdomain to IP
- Web Server: Serves static content, reverse proxy
- Application Server: Executes application code
- Database: Stores/manages application data
- Communication: HTTP/HTTPS over TCP/IP

## Issues
1. SPOF: Single server failure takes down everything
2. Downtime: Maintenance requires server restart
3. No scalability: Cannot handle high traffic
4. Security: All components on same server
5. Performance: Limited resources, bottlenecks
